This test uses FIO to spawn a number of threads to perform a particular type of
I/O. This test will use block sizes of 4k, 8k, and 16k. It will also attempt
to simulate the disk traffic during a boot, login, and web surfing. It tests
both sequential and random data access.

NOTE: If autoupdate or another program accesses the spare root partition
while this test is running corruption may occur.
