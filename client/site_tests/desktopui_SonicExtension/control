This test loads an extension through chromedriver and navigates to a test
utility page used to configure the extension. It requires the ip address
of a sonic host, and that the sonic host is on the same subnet as the
Device Under Test.

Usage: test_that <ip address of DUT> --board=<boardname of DUT>
           --args="sonic_hostname=<ip or name of sonichost>,
                   extension_path=/path/to/local/extension_in_testdir"

The extension_path is optional, if none is specified the default ToT
extension will get used. If one is specified, it must reside in the
test's root directory (i.e autotest_checkout/client/site_tests/\
                           desktopui_SonicExtension/).
