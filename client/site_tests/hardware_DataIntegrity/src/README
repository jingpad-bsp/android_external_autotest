datint
------

This program checks for data integrity and retention on storage devices.
It writes data chunks that contain certain information used for verification.

Chunk data fields:
LBA - logical block address (offset into partition in multiples of block size)
GEN - chunk genration number (number of times the block was written)
TIM - timestamp of last write to block
RID - run id (unique identifier for this test)

Verification:
During the verification phase the LBA and GEN values are compared to what is
expected. For example, if the program writes LBA 3 seven times, then the
program expects that when it reads LBA 3, it has 7 for the GEN number.

In case that the data does not match what is expected, the other pieces of
information in the data chunk can give a hint to what might have caused the
data corruption.

Usage:
 datint [options] file

Options:
 -h            print this menu
 -s            seed for random number gen. (default is 0)
 -m            random LBA (default is serialized)
 -r            read-only (default is read/write)
 -w            write-only (default is read/write)
 -x            random w/r (default is read/write)
 -b <number>   beginnig LBA (default is 0)
 -e <number>   bounding LBA (default is file size)
 -i <number>   number of test iterations (default is 1)
 -z <number>   i/o block size (multiple of default 512)

Example uses:

Serialized writes and reads. First write all LBAs and then read them back for
verification.

datint /dev/sda3

Randomized writes and reads. Do writes and reads at random. If trying to read
a block that was not previously written, the program will instead write the
block.

datint -x /dev/sda3

Like above, but randomized the blocks as well.

datint -x -m /dev/sda3

Specify block range.

datint -b 3 -e 37 /dev/sda3

Specify i/o block size (block size must be a multiple of 512).

datint -z 1024 /dev/sda3
