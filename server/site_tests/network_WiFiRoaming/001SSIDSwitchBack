# This test run is designed to test that the connection manager is able
# to rejoin a previously connected AP when it loses connectivity to its
# current AP.  To accomplish this, we join one AP (so we are sure that
# this flimflam instance remembers it), then join a second AP which we
# shut down while the DUT is connected to it.  We sit around and observe
# if and how long it takes for the connection manager to re-acquire
# connectivity to the first AP.
