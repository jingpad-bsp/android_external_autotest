  # Test the boot performance.  Add a generous constraint (at least for
  # x86 platforms) on the boot time.  We just look at the time from
  # kernel start to login prompt and require it to be under 18s.  As of
  # 3/30/2010 the time is 13.5s on a slow HDD platform.  Note that this
  # may still fail if this is run on on a platform machine before
  # /home/chronos is populated (that seems to add another 23s). But as
  # BuildVerify tests are run after the boot after reimaging, the
  # home directory should already be populated.  Once we are running
  # these tests only on qualified systems we can lower the constraints
  # to be in-line with suite_HWQual.  Once we are running our own firmware
  # and we have firmware timing support on ARM we can also add the
  # constraint on firmware boot time.
