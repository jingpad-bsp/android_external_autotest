This test suite runs automated tests that record measurements for various
system metrics.  In many cases a single test is repeated for a reasonable
sample such as completing 50 reboots in one test.  The values recorded
will be used to identify performance/resource regressions and to alert
contributing (and previously unaware) developers of the impact.
Ideally these are run for each build in order to make blame easier.
