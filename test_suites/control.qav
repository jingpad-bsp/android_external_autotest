This is the QA Validation suite.

Add tests to this suite that are used to give a signal regarding the quality
of a feature or area on Chrome OS that should run every build.

These tests are only run on full release builds, not on the commit queue.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
