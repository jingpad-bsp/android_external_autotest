This test suite runs automated WiFi enclosure tests that should all pass.

WiFiMatFunc and WiFiSecMat make up a suite of 3-machine tests to validate
basic WiFi functionality. One client, one server, and one programmable WiFi
AP/Router are required (either off-the-shelf with a network-accesible CLI or a
Linux/BSD system with a WiFi card that supports HostAP functionality).

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
